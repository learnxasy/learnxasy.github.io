Anyone who has used computers understand that computers need to be "programmed"—whatever 
that means. But to many people, *computer programming* sounds like an ability that is
reserved for those with superhuman technical skills—like movie hackers or billionaire tech founders.

In reality, *computer programming* is just a fancy way of saying "telling a computer what to do." A *computer program* is then "the instructions telling a computer what to do." 

As it turns out, computers are not the only thing that can be "programmed." If you've 
ever made a To-Do list, taught a dog how to sit, or written a how-to guide or recipe, you've already programmed before! Unlike a human or a dog, however, computers are 
**very** good at following instructions. And for some kinds of instructions, they can do 
them much faster.

Unfortunately, computers aren't as good at understanding language as humans or even dogs 
are. Therefore, in order to give them instructions, we need to use a *programming 
language*—a specific way of writing instructions (sometimes refered to as *code*) so 
that a computer can understand. There are hundreds of different programming languages, 
all with their own pros and cons. In this course, we will be using a language called 
[Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org).
